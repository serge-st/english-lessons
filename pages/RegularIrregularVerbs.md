# Regular and Irregular Verbs

In English there are two types of verbs:

1. Regular
2. Irregular

## Regular vs Irregular Verbs

If you can form the simple past tense of a verb simply by adding "-ed" or "-d" to it, then it is a **regular** verb.

If a verb doesn't follow these patterns, it is an irregular verb.

### Examples:

| Type          | Base Form | Simple Past | Past Participle |
| ------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Regular**   | Jump      | Jumped      | Jumped          |
| **Irregular** | Go        | Went        | Gone            |
